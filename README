Edit `config.js` to provide your own values for:

    config.endpoint
    config.primaryKey

Both of these values are shown at the end of the output from the create_cosmosdb.py script.
You can also find these values in the Azure portal under 'Keys' for your Cosmos DB account.

Once updated, run this locally with `npm start`, or ideally, push to Azure Web Apps
